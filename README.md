### About this file
The purpose of this file is to provide basic overview, setup, usage and other instructions as well as the general background information about the project.

### Project Description
Vocabuilder helps language learners quickly expand their vocabulary and retain knowledge for a long time. The app implements the popular and scientifically proven spaced repetition technique, adapting the review intervals based on the user's mastery level of each word. The user creates word sets or imports ready-made ones, then regularly reviews them at optimal times for better memorization.

### Key Features
The app has the following key features:
- [ ] creating flashcards with words, translations, examples, and pronunciation;

- [ ] importing and exporting word sets;

- [ ] spaced repetition algorithm with dynamic interval adjustment;

- [ ] user-friendly interface for flashcard learning;

- [ ] progress statistics and review history;

- [x] support for multiple interface languages and word sets;

- [x] support for light/dark (day/night) themes.
